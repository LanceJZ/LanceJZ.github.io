                    <p>This is Lance Zimmerman and I created this website to share my latest shared video game projects.</p>
                    <p>Even more recently I've been learning the Xenko game engine. It uses C# for scripting, kind of like Unity does, only it follows a more XNA style API. It is open source and uses SharpDX. It was fun making Asteroids with it too. Next I'm going to make a tutor for it, as there really are none. It performs really well too, my Asteroids project I just got done in Xenko runs with an average of 6% CPU on my desktop, and 14% on my old laptop at 60FPS.</p>
                    <p>August 2018: I have been getting deep into <a href="http://www.monogame.net/">MonoGame</a> 3.7 with my revamped Panther game engine. I use Visual Studio 2017  I've been doing game jams as often as I can as well. I did six in the last two years. I even made a Visual Studio 2017 project template that includes my engine code.</p>
                    <p>I found a new open source game engine that looks interesting. <a href="http://www.evergine.com">Evergine</a></p>
                    <p>November 2016: I upgraded my desktop to a 4ghz octocore with 32GB RAM and gave my old desktop to my partner in crime Jenni Jewell. She also helps me with some graphics in some of my games. I also found <a href="http://xenko.com/">Xenko</a>, Paradox 3D renamed, currently in open source and it is good enough at version 1.8.3 Beta for me to spend time with at this point. So I'm making Asteroids using it, and it uses C# and the open source version of XNA. Xenko is at version 3 as of August 2nd 2018 and now MIT licenced open source, so I'll have to try it again. Feels kind of weird going back to C#, but I thought I should keep both my C++ and C# skillz sharp.</p>
                    <p>I will post all of my video game projects on <a href="https://github.com/LanceJZ">Github</a>, all open source. I hope to share what I've learned so others may learn from it. Remember, sharing is caring. So far I have two game projects that are active. Vector Omega Race and Base Defender.</p>
                    <p>I'm still working on rebooting a game I did using XNA4 years ago named Base Defender. I will upload it as soon as it is at a point that it does something. I am behind because my desktop HDD failed, and I've been saving up money to replace it. Don't worry I had the project backed up. My old 500GB high speed system HDD November of 2016, and that has been replaced with a new Samsung 3D 850 EVO 500GB SSD that is about ten times faster.</p>
                    <p>I started learning C++ in 2012. In that time I have learned much, but I also know I have so much more to learn. It helped so much that I already had a good grasp of programming. I started learning to program video games using C# using XNA back in 2009. See my projects below.</p>

I made my own 3D library for the graphics that includes text and numbers made in voxels awhile back and I wanted to test it. That was much fun.</p>

                    <p>On September of 2015 I started a new project to recreate the classic arcade game from the 80s known as Asteroids Deluxe by Atari. I used C++ 11 with the Polycode library in this project. I've since then made some other improvements on the game play.  I've improved both performance and code maintenance ease. It also saves the top ten list. I built on the Asteroids game I did two months before this one. Making the AI for the “Death Star” and its ships was the most fun and most time time-consuming part. I made a few small changes to the original, improvements in-game play. The shields recharge slowly over time when not in use is one change. See if you can spot any others. This one took longer because I did not work on it from November to mid January as time did not permit. (Fallout 4) This game is complete and you can download a binary for Windows in a rar file to try it out and is included. The Polycode binaries are also included in a rar file as used to compile the game for Windows using Visual Studio 2015. You will find the audio files in a rar file as well for those who want to play with the source code. The audio files are also in the binary game release rar file.</p>

                    <p>On May 30th I completed the last tutor I had time for. I was ready to test if I could make a game using Unity 5 so I started what is my ritual game for a new engine or library. Asteroids, making it as close to the original as I can. It was pretty easy, just needed to figure out the methods of Unity 5, it has changed much since the first time I used it years ago. I'm sharing the code to help anyone else that may have had the same issues to get past that I had. You can play it in the web too here.

                    <p>On January of 2014 I started a new project to recreate the classic arcade game from the 80s known as Omega Race. I used SDL2 in this project as well. I've since than made some other improvements on the game code that I will take back to Asteroids. I've improved both performance and code maintenance. I've got most of the game mechanics code done, I just need to get the final touches done. This project has been put on hold so I could reboot Base Defender.</p>

                    <p>On November of 2013 I converted my Asteroids project that I did earlier that year that I used the Allegro library so that it used the SDL2 one instead. I made a few improvements as well as it no longer used normal fonts. I created a line based font for the game that I plan on using in future vector based games as well.</p>
