                    <p>This is Lance Zimmerman and I created this web site to share my latest shared video game projects.</p>
                    <p>I will post all of my video game projects on Git-hub, all open source. I hope to share what I've learned so others may learn from it. Remember, sharing is caring. So far I have two game projects that are active. Vector Asteroids and Vector Omega Race.</p>
                    <p>I'm currently working on rebooting a game I did using XNA 2 years ago named Base Defender. I'm making it in C++ using SFML2. I will upload it as soon as it is at a point that it does something. I am behind because my desktop HDD failed, and I've been saving up money to replace it. Don't worry I had the project backed up.</p>
                    <p>I started learning C++ in 2012. In that time I have learned much, but I also know I have so much more to learn. It helped so much that I already had a good grasp of programming. I started learning to program video games using C# using XNA back in 2009.</p>

                    <p>On May 30th I compleated the last tutor I had time for. I was ready to test if I could make a game using Unity 5 so I started what is my ritual game for a new engine or library. Asteroids, making it as close to the orginal as I can. It was pretty easy, just needed to figure out the mythods of Unity 5, it has changed much sense the first time I used it years ago. I'm sharing the code to help anyone else that my have had the same issues to get past that I had. You can play it in the web too here. <a href="../LanceJZ.github.io/Unity/AsteroidsWebV1.html">Asteroids in Unity 5 Web Player</a></p>

                    <p>On January of 2014 I started a new project to recreate the classic arcade game from the 80s known as Omega Race. I used SDL2 in this project as well. I've sense than made some other improvements on the game code that I will take back to Asteroids. I've improved both performance and code maintenance. I've got most of the game mechanics code done, I just need to get the final touches done. This project has been put on hold so I could reboot Base Defender.</p>

                    <p>On November of 2013 I converted my Asteroids project that I did earlier that year that I used the Allegro library so that it used the SDL2 one instead. I made a few improvements as well as it no longer used normal fonts. I created a line based font for the game that I plan on using in future vector based games as well.</p>
